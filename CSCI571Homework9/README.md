Dear Grader,

I have developed this project using the demo code I downloaded at: 

https://github.com/dekatotoro/SlideMenuControllerSwift

However, I have modified most of the code in almost all the files to work for this homework. 

Also, I have using cocoapods libraries as follow:

  pod 'Alamofire', :git => 'https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git', :branch => 'master'
  pod 'SwiftSpinner', :git => 'https://github.com/icanzilb/SwiftSpinner.git', :branch => 'master'
  pod 'SwiftyJSON', :git => 'https://github.com/BaiduHiDeviOS/SwiftyJSON.git', :branch => 'swift3'
  pod 'SDWebImage', '~>3.8'

  pod 'SlideMenuControllerSwift'

It would be thankful if you can exclude all the code in the original project downloaded from the link I mentioned above and all the libraries when checking my code in MOSS.

Thanks,
Jialin
